> The standard way of developing something is called a procedural paradigm

> OOP is a new paradigm that allows you to think of programming like real objects instead of instructions

> OOP is a collection of functions and data that can be  grouped into what's called an object 

> When you need to access an object, you instantiate a class that contains it 

>> OOP helps you save time by grouping a bunch of data and functions together 

> OOP more scalable than procedural
