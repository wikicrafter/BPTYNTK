> GIT - is a online repository for saving versions of code
> Old solution was to save them on local hard drives, but it was inefficient 
> This system is easy to set up and access in the cloud
> GIT helps you keep track of what other team members are working on and what's the latest version of the code

##### GitHub helps you track of what other team members are working on, and what's the latest version of the code
