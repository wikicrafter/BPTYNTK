# Communication with computers

### The language of computer

_Computers have their own language called machine code, which is really hard to understand for humans_

_Peripherals and other devices communicate through machine code_

_The simple version of machine code consists of 0s and 1s, also called binary system. 1=yes, 0=no_

### The motherboard transfers messages to the processor by sending electricity through the wires in the board

_Letting electricity go is a 1 and stopping it is a 0_

_In seconds computers can send close to a million 0s and 1s_

_The old computers was giant tubes, and they were using air instead of electricity_


## There is a spectrum of programming code, from low level to high level code


##### Low level code:
* used by basic system and basic pieces of hardware
* long, inefficient, hard to read or write
* infinitely customizable
* machine speak is the ultimate low level code

##### Mid level code:
* used by peripherals 
* slightly higher lever than 0s and 1s
* peripherals might require a driver to be installed 
* a driver is a interpreter that translates your input for your system

##### High level code:
* used by programmers
* designed to make things faster
* shorter, easier to read
* less descriptive and more restricted
